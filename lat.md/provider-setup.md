# Provider setup

The first-run screen where the user picks an AI provider and enters credentials before the app is usable. Rendered by [[src/renderer/src/screens/Setup/Setup.tsx]], it writes the chosen provider/base-URL via `setModelConfig` and any key via `setEnv`.

The provider list is data-driven from `PROVIDERS.setup` in [[src/renderer/src/constants.ts]]. Each entry carries an `envKey`, `configProvider`, `baseUrl`, and `needsKey`; selecting a card drives which form fields show (API key, or the Local server/base-URL flow).

## Hermes One is the first-priority provider

**Hermes One Inference** (`https://inference.hermesone.org/v1`) is Hermes One's own OpenAI-compatible gateway, listed **first** in `PROVIDERS.setup`, `PROVIDER_CARDS`, and the `SETTINGS_SECTIONS` "LLM Providers" items — so it leads the Add-provider picker.

It is not a canonical agent provider, so it routes through `custom` + `base_url` exactly like the `openai` card, with its key stored/host-derived as `HERMESONE_API_KEY` (`inference.hermesone.org` → `HERMESONE_API_KEY` in [[src/shared/url-key-map.ts]], and `hermesone` in `OPENAI_COMPAT_PROVIDERS`). It appears in `OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_BASE_URLS` so `displayProviderFromConfig` reverse-maps it back to the Hermes One card on reload, and its logo (`detectBrand` → `hermesone`, the `hermes-icon.svg` mark) shows in the grids. Users get a key from the console's Credits → API keys.

## Top grid mirrors the agent's native providers

The top provider grid shows only providers the upstream agent supports natively; generic OpenAI-compatible endpoints live in the Local presets instead.

The source of truth is `CANONICAL_PROVIDERS` in the bundled agent (`hermes-agent/hermes_cli/models.py`) — the registry of providers with first-class auth/base-URL handling (nous, openrouter, anthropic, openai-codex, openai-api, gemini, xai, xiaomi, ollama-cloud, deepseek, …). A card belongs in the top grid only if it maps to a canonical slug. `aimlapi` was removed from the grid because it has no canonical entry; it remains reachable as a **Local → Remote OpenAI-Compatible APIs** preset.

## OpenAI-compatible endpoints route through Local

Endpoints the agent does not natively support (Groq, DeepSeek, Together, Fireworks, Cerebras, AtlasCloud, Mistral, AIML, …) are offered as `LOCAL_PRESETS` chips under the `local` card, not as top-level cards.

Selecting a preset sets the base URL; the API-key env var is resolved by `resolveCustomEnvKey` — first an exact `LOCAL_PRESETS.envKey` match, then [[src/shared/url-key-map.ts]] by host. So a compatible provider configures correctly without a dedicated card (e.g. `api.aimlapi.com` → `AIMLAPI_API_KEY`).

## Active model is picked from configured providers

The Providers tab ([[src/renderer/src/screens/Providers/Providers.tsx]]) sets the default (active) model by choosing from what's already configured, not by free-form entry — there's no more provider chip grid, manual model/base-URL fields, or inline API-key input.

The screen is organized as three tabs: Providers, Models, and Auxiliary Tasks. Providers owns the active provider/model credentials, while Models and Auxiliary Tasks embed [[src/renderer/src/screens/Models/Models.tsx]] so the saved model library and per-task model overrides live beside the provider configuration instead of as a separate sidebar destination.

The **MODEL** section shows a read-only summary (logo + provider label + model). A **Change** button opens a picker modal with a **provider** picker (a custom `LogoSelect` — the brand logo renders inside the control and each option, which a native `<select>` can't do) and a native **model** dropdown. Confirming sets `modelProvider`/`modelName`/`modelBaseUrl`, which the existing debounced auto-save persists to `config.yaml` via `setModelConfig` (compat providers as `custom` + base_url). The **API key is resolved automatically** at runtime — the picker never asks for it.

The provider list (`pickerProviders`) is sourced from the **configured providers** — the same set shown as LLM cards — NOT from which providers happen to have saved models: keyed FieldDef providers (`env[f.key]` set, in FieldDef order so Hermes One leads) plus named custom providers whose `customProviderEnvKey(label)` is set. So a freshly-keyed provider with no models yet still appears.

The **model** dropdown merges that provider's saved models with live discovery ([[src/renderer/src/hooks/useDiscoveredModels.ts#useDiscoveredModels]]) so a just-configured provider is immediately usable. On confirm, a discovered-only model is persisted via `addModel` first (so its key resolves and it reappears), and compat providers store `custom` + their `OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_BASE_URLS` base URL.

The debounced auto-save keeps a guard from the grid era that still applies: `saveModelConfig` skips persisting a `custom` selection whose `base_url` is empty (writing it would clobber config.yaml with a dead endpoint) — **unless** config.yaml already holds a custom endpoint, tracked by the `persistedCustomUrl` ref (refreshed on load and after each save). In that case the empty value IS persisted, so deliberately clearing a configured custom endpoint doesn't leave the UI (empty) and config.yaml (old URL) disagreeing after navigation/relaunch.

## LLM-provider keys are configured-only, via modals

The `SETTINGS_SECTIONS` "LLM Providers" section no longer renders a static key card for every known provider (an overwhelming wall of empty inputs). It shows only providers with a key set, plus an **Add provider** action.

[[src/renderer/src/components/ProviderKeysSection.tsx#ProviderKeysSection]] renders the configured cards + an Add tile; Add opens a searchable picker modal (logo per provider) → a per-provider config modal (key input with show/hide, **Remove provider**). It's a presentation layer over the same `env` state + `handleChange`/`handleBlur`/`handleRemove` handlers in [[src/renderer/src/screens/Providers/Providers.tsx]], so persistence is unchanged (`setEnv`); removing clears the env var.

The section is rendered **standalone, above the credential pool** rather than in the `SETTINGS_SECTIONS.map` position — it's the primary surface for configuring providers and the models the top active-model selector picks from, so it sits before the advanced multi-key pool. The map skips the `constants.sectionLlmProviders` entry (an inline title check returning null); other `SETTINGS_SECTIONS` (non-LLM) still render inline in place, after the pool.

### Named custom providers

The picker offers a **Custom provider** tile (last) for any OpenAI-compatible endpoint not covered by a built-in card. You can add **multiple**, each with a distinct name, base URL, and its own key.

There is no separate store — a custom provider *is* its name + base URL + the models routed to it in `models.json`.

The config modal collects **Name**, **Base URL**, and an API key. The key is stored under the provider's dedicated env var, [[src/shared/url-key-map.ts#customProviderEnvKey]]`(name)` → `CUSTOM_PROVIDER_<SANITISED_NAME>_KEY` — so two custom providers never share a key. Models are added through the same [[src/renderer/src/components/ProviderKeysSection.tsx#ProviderModelsManager]] with an explicit `{ provider: "custom", baseUrl }` route plus `providerLabel = name`; that label is persisted on each [[src/main/models.ts#SavedModel]] (`providerLabel`) via [[src/main/models.ts#addModel]] (whose dedup now includes base URL, so the same model id can exist under two endpoints).

Configured custom providers are re-derived from `models.json` on load: `provider: "custom"` models whose host resolves to `CUSTOM_API_KEY` (known compat hosts like groq/hermesone are excluded — they own dedicated key cards), grouped by `providerLabel` (falling back to host for legacy unlabeled models). Each shows as a card titled by its name; **Remove provider** deletes its models and clears its `CUSTOM_PROVIDER_*` key. The runtime resolves the same key: [[src/main/hermes.ts]] looks up the base-URL-matched model and derives `customProviderEnvKey(providerLabel ?? name)`, so every model under a provider shares that provider's key.

### Adding a curated partner provider

Sponsor/partner providers (and Hermes One itself) are OpenAI-compatible custom endpoints under the hood but are presented **first-class** — curated in-app, exactly like `hermesone`, with their own host-derived key and branding.

To add one, mirror the Hermes One entries: a card in `PROVIDERS.setup` + `PROVIDER_CARDS` + a base URL in `OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_BASE_URLS` ([[src/renderer/src/constants.ts]]), a `URL_KEY_MAP` entry giving it a dedicated `<PARTNER>_API_KEY` in [[src/shared/url-key-map.ts]], and a `detectBrand` rule + logo in [[src/renderer/src/components/common/BrandLogo.tsx]].

## Models live under each provider (OpenCode-style)

A provider's config modal also manages the models it serves, so the provider→models hierarchy lives in one place instead of a separate flat list.

[[src/renderer/src/components/ProviderKeysSection.tsx#ProviderModelsManager]] renders below the key field in the config modal: a key-status line, the model pills, and an add-input. It reads/writes the same `models.json` library the Models screen uses (`listModels`/`addModel`/`removeModel`, and re-syncs on `onModelLibraryChanged`), so added models immediately appear in the chat model picker. Models show as removable chips; the add-input autocompletes off live discovery and strips whitespace as typed/pasted (model IDs never contain spaces, so `"hello there"` can't be saved).

The single [[src/renderer/src/hooks/useDiscoveredModels.ts#useDiscoveredModels]] call does double duty: it feeds the add-input's `<datalist>` **and** drives the "Connected · key verified" status line — a `status: "ok"` means the endpoint accepted the key and returned a model list, so the "verified" claim is truthful. `unsupported`/`unknown-host` degrade to a plain "Connected" (key set, list not exposed), `error` to "Couldn't verify key", and an empty key to "Add a key to connect".

The env key is the only anchor the modal has, so persistence routing is derived from it by [[src/renderer/src/constants.ts#providerRouteForEnvKey]]: it scans `PROVIDERS.setup` (returning `{provider: configProvider ?? id, baseUrl}`) then `LOCAL_PRESETS` (always `custom` + `baseUrl`), falling back to a bare `custom` route. Native providers keep their agent slug (the gateway hardcodes the base URL); OpenAI-compatible providers save as `provider: "custom"` + explicit `baseUrl` — the same routing the Models screen / Providers tab apply, so entries stay consistent regardless of where they were added.

Ids the agent can't resolve by id are listed in `OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_BASE_URLS` ([[src/renderer/src/constants.ts]]) — openai, perplexity, and every `LOCAL_PRESETS` chip (local servers + remote endpoints like groq, deepseek, atlascloud, mistral, …). This map MUST contain every preset id, or selecting that chip mis-routes; a test in `tests/constants.test.ts` enforces it. Selecting one autofills its base URL and shows the base-URL field; on save it is persisted as `provider: custom` + `base_url`, which the gateway accepts and uses to host-derive the API key (`runtime_provider._host_derived_api_key`, e.g. `api.groq.com` → `GROQ_API_KEY`). `displayProviderFromConfig` reverse-maps a stored `custom` + known base URL back to the brand id so the dropdown re-selects it on load. Native providers (the gateway hardcodes their base URL) clear the field instead.

## Switching providers rewrites the transport (`api_mode`)

Activating a model must rewrite or clear `model.api_mode`, or a stale protocol from the previous model routes the new endpoint over the wrong transport — dropping connections when switching OpenAI- and Anthropic-compatible custom endpoints.

The gateway's runtime-provider resolver honors a persisted `model.api_mode` (`anthropic_messages` vs `chat_completions`, …) for `custom`/compatible providers, and only auto-detects from the base URL (`/anthropic` suffix, `api.openai.com`, …) when the key is absent. So a leftover `anthropic_messages` would keep an OpenAI-compatible endpoint pointed at `/v1/messages` (404 / lost connection).

[[src/main/config.ts#setModelConfig]] takes an optional `apiMode` argument, handled exactly like `context_length`: a non-empty string sets `model.api_mode`, `null`/empty removes it (so auto-detection resumes), `undefined` leaves it untouched. The `set-model-config` IPC handler ([[src/main/ipc/register.ts]]) resolves it from the activated model's `apiMode` library field ([[src/main/models.ts#SavedModel]]) — `null` when the entry has none — alongside the `contextLength` mirror, on both the pure-local and remote-fallback local writes. Custom-provider library entries carry `apiMode` because `loadCustomProviders` reads `api_mode` from each `custom_providers:` block.

The library lookup runs through [[src/main/ipc/register.ts#resolveLibraryModelEntry]], which disambiguates by base URL when several entries share the same provider+model — e.g. two `custom` endpoints exposing the same model id over different transports. A bare provider+model match would return the first entry and persist its `api_mode` for the other endpoint, routing it over the wrong protocol; matching the base URL too keeps each endpoint's transport correct. Single-entry activations are unaffected.

## Provider icons

Each card's logo is resolved by [[src/renderer/src/components/common/BrandLogo.tsx]] from the provider id, falling back to a generic robot for unknown ids.

`detectBrand` matches the provider/model string to a `BrandKey`, and `matchTheme` flattens every logo to a single white/black tint so colored and `currentColor` SVGs render uniformly in the grid's logo tiles.

The Local/Remote preset chips are also branded: each renders the same `BrandLogo` (by preset id) to the left of its name in a row. `llama.cpp` is mapped off the Meta logo to the generic API mark (the `/llama/` substring would otherwise tag it, and Ollama, as Meta); any preset without a bundled logo falls back to the generic mark.
